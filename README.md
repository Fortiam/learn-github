#Learn GitHub 
This is a throwaway repo used to learn about working with Git and GitHub.

At the bottom of the README.md file add an additional sentence (for instance, Adding another sentence.). Scroll to the bottom of the page to the commit interface. Add a commit message, make sure the "Commit directly to master branch" option is selected, then click "Commit changes" button.
